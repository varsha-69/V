#Introduction to AI/ML  

-Artificial intelligence allow machines to sense, reason, act, and adapt like humansThe broader concept of enabling machines to mimic human behavior and decision-making. AI systems are built using ML and other techniques.  
-Data scientists study patterns in data to create ML models, and then optimize those models based on the patterns.  
-ML is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data and improve their accuracy over time.  

#Some examples of AI and ML include:  
-Deep learning: A complex ML technique that uses artificial neural networks to solve tasks.  
-Natural language processing (NLP): Uses specialized algorithms to process and analyze human speech and languages.  
-Computer vision: Uses algorithms to extract, process, and analyze information from digital images and videos.  
-Robotics: Uses AI to develop robots that can interpret environments, manipulate objects, and interact with humans.  

#Applications in different domains  

1.Finance: According to some recent surveys, 80% of banks accept that AI can provide them benefits according to their decisions in finance. From providing corporate finance advice to predicting the future outcome relate to finance, AI is capable of them Also it is used to send automated tests and mail, predict risk in loans, and detect any unwanted transactional activities, of the targeted customers. Spam and fraud filters, uncharacterized actions, responding to threats, etc are the tools that help in the field.  

2.Government- AI in government workflows allows agencies to prevent or minimize cyber attacks. Using AI, government organizations can: Monitor unusual network activity and entry points. Identify potential data vulnerabilities and fortify access restrictions to critical data.  

3.Healthcare- Artificial Intelligence is widely used in the field of healthcare and medicine. The various algorithms of Artificial Intelligence app are used to build precise machines that are able to detect minor diseases inside the human body. Also, Artificial Intelligence uses the medical history and current situation of a particular human being to predict future diseases. Artificial Intelligence is also used to find the current vacant beds in the hospitals of a city that saves the time of patients who are in emergency conditions.  

4.Education- Educational sectors are totally organized and managed by human involvement till some years back. But these days, the educational sector is also coming under the influence of Artificial Intelligence app. It helps the faculty as well as the students by making course recommendations, Analysing some data and some decisions about the student, etc. Making automated messages to the students, and parents regarding any vacation, and test results are done by Artificial Intelligence these days.  

5.Entertainment- AI is also used in the field of movies and entertainment. This field uses artificial intelligence for tagging various content to a specific person. Also, the entertainment industry used artificial intelligence for the categorization and classification of content according to the user.  

#Difference between AI ML and DL:  
-AI is a computer algorithm that exhibits intelligence via decision-making. ML is an algorithm of AI that assists systems to learn from different types of datasets. DL is an algorithm of ML that uses several layers of neural networks to analyze data and provide output accordingly.  

#Python Fundamentals  

Introduction:  
-Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.  

-It is used for:  
web development (server-side),  
software development,  
mathematics,  
system scripting.  

-Why python?
Python is popular because it's an open-source language with a simple syntax. It's also relatively easy to learn and use, so Python code can be written and executed quickly. Other benefits of Python include: Extensive support libraries, User-friendly data structures, and Productivity and speed.  

-Libraries:  
A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we donâ€™t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.  
Few python libraries are NumPy, Pandas.  

-Control Statements:  
Control statements direct the flow of a Python program's execution. They introduce logic, decision-making, and looping. Key control statements in Python include if/else, for/while, break/continue, and pass. Let's get into our lesson to understand these concepts clearly.  

-Functions:  
Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.  

-Why is python predominantly used?  
Python is more commonly used for ML compared to Java. Since Python has extensive libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow) and simpler syntax, enabling faster development and experimentation, it is the preferred programming language.
